# hello-world

Hello People,

I am Shubham, and I am new here (until I don't edit this). I have recently quit my job to pursue my passion for mathematics and learn programming and I am beginning with Android Development. I am currently undertaking Android Basics Nanodegree by Google on Udacity. I wanna be a top notch developer pretty fast. It's time to make justice to the "quick learner" phrase on the resume!
